# ft232h-aardvark-clone

A simple project to clone the TotalPhase Aardvark probe.
This repo contains the Kicad project files for a shield of the cjmcu-ft232h board.  

This shield provides two IDC10 connectors:
- one Aardvark-like connector for SPI/I2C communication
- one AZ-Delivery logic Analizer connector
